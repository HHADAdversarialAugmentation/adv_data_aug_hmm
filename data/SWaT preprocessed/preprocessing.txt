The SWaT dataset was processed using the library StandardScaler and PCA from sklearn, with parameters n_components=2 for the PCA. For the seasonal decomposition, we used the implementation found in statsmodels. We applied the function seasonal_decompose on the PCA components, which results in two outputs: seasonality and residues. They were then combined to obtain the processed datasets.
