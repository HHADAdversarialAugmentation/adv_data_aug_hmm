The SWaT dataset was processed using the library StandardScaler and PCA from sklearn, with parameters n_components=2 for the PCA. For the seasonal decomposition, we used the implementation found in statsmodels. We applied the function seasonal_decompose on the PCA components with period=4194. This results in two outputs: seasonality and residues which are then summed to obtain the processed datasets.
